# overview
Younes, the goal of this document is to document the things you know that you don't know about live patching. the idea is not to limit you to studying this document. I know
how easy you get bored with stuff, however, your end goal is to be able to manuver the kernel and be able to understand the code. given this goal, after a while try to read
the stuff documented and see if you came to know if you understand them now. this is a nice way to measure progress.

# known unknowns
* ftrace: The function tracer calls the code from a predefined location that is close to the function entry point. This location is generated by the compiler using the '-pg' 
  gcc option. read more: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/trace/ftrace.rst
* kprobe: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/trace/kprobes.rst
* per-task consistency and syscall barrier
