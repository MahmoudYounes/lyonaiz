# The linux kernel docs

- LTTng is a powerful tracing toolkit. youi can search for it lttng.org/docs in order to install. this also has 
  a nice GUI tool called tracecompass that interprets the output of the trace utilities.
- there are a bunch of static analyzers for the kernel specifically. the most important and good one is sparse
- Procmap visualize the complete Kernel Virtual Address Space
- ctags and cscope kernel browsing tools. need to get familiar with them
- there are three ways to get a starting config for building the kernel:
  - use configs from /boot/$(uname -r)
  - use configs from $LINUX_ROOT/arch/<processor-arch/configs
  - use a file containing loaded mods exported and executing localmodconfig target
  ```Bash
  lsmod > /tmp/lsmod.now # any file name
  make LSMOD=/tmp/lsmod.now localmodconfig
  ```

- linux kernel coding style [style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html)
- Kconfig [syntax](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt)
- Why initramfs?
  Imagine for a moment that you are in the business of building and maintaining a new Linux distribution. Now, at installation time, the end user of your distribution might decide to format their SCSI disk with the reiserfs filesystem (FYI, it's the earliest general-purpose journaled filesystem in the kernel). The thing is, you cannot know in advance what choice exactly the end user will make â€“ it could be one of any number of filesystems. So, you decide to pre-build and supply a large variety of kernel modules that will fulfill almost every possibility. Fine, when the installation is complete and the user's system boots up, the kernel will, in this scenario, require the reiserfs.ko kernel module in order to successfully mount the root filesystem and thus proceed with system boot-up.
  ut wait, think about this, we now have a classic chicken-and-egg problem: in order for the kernel to mount the root filesystem, it requires the reiserfs.ko kernel module file to be loaded into RAM (as it contains the necessary code to be able to work with the filesystem). But, that file is itself embedded inside the reiserfs root filesystem; to be precise, within the /lib/modules/<kernel-ver>/kernel/fs/reiserfs/ directory! One of the primary purposes of the initramfs framework is to solve this chicken-and-egg problem.
  
  initramfs contains basic structure of rootfs and has all modules (*.ko) files. cpio file is a flat file format used by tar

- Big distributions like Ubuntu, insert a huge array of modules in the linux kernel because
  they don't know before hand which Hardware will be used to run the linux kernel.

# Controlling the log level of printk
- the /proc/sys/kernel/printk shows 4 numbers
```bash
$ echo /proc/sys/kernel/printk
4 4 1 7
```
<current> <default level> <minimum allowed level> <boot time default>

However to enable pr_debug &| pr_devel output in dmesg you need to compile the module with extra cflags.
```make
CFLAGS_printk_loglvl.o := -DDEBUG
```

to print all the messages of printk regardless of the level (ignore_level)
the kernel needs to boot with a cmd line `ignore_level`

or at runtime: sudo bash -c "echo Y > /sys/module/printk/parameters/ignore_loglevel"

or through dmesg see --console-level option

# About the Kernel
- Major subsystems:
     core kernel - (user and kernel) process and thread creation/destruction,
	           CPU, scheduling, synchronization primitives, signaling,
		   timers, interrupt handling, namespaces, cgroups, module
		   support, crypto, etc
     memory management
     VFS (filesystem support)
     block IO
     network protocol stack
     IPC (Inter Process Communication) support
     sound (audio) support
     virtualization support
    
- the kernel module has access to only a subset of all kernel APIs and
   data structures (more on this in the next chapter!)

- the path /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build is a symlink to a subset of the linux tree. it contains many of the utilities
  required by modules to build for example. notice in case of building the linux kernel on Ubuntu you get the build 
  symlinked to the root of the linux kernel source tree.

- loading and removing modules has a support in the kernel Capabilities model. man page on capabilities(7) for details.

# Memory Layout
memory in OS is split into layers. biggest layer is called Node. Node is composed of zones, and
zones is composed of areas.
check `lstopo` and `lstopo-no-graphics` to visualize this structure and the PCI buses as a bonus.


# BSA (Buddy System Allocation)
this is the buddy allocation algorithm that is used in kernel. on initialization, it pre-maps the
whole memory in the RAM that is allocatable. (remember: the lowmemory region in the kernel memory
space maps all the RAM memory. this is possible since we are talking about the virtual memory of 
the kernel space, which ideally would be much bigger than the actual memory 
(4GBs on 32bits & up to 2 ^ 64 / 2 << 60 eta bytes on 64bits "actually 
it is much less since only 48 bits are used for addressing"). this alogirhtm splits
the memory into a list of sizes. these sizes are determined by an input called order. this is a 
kconfig that is passed to kernel on build time (CONFIG_ORDER). the algorithm pre allocates memory
according to the order as mentioned. order is an integer number. the granular unit of memory the
kernel uses is a page which is 4k. let's say the order is 11? the kernel allocates 11 different 
sizes of memory according to this rule:
2^i * 4 -> is the final size returned. where i belongs to [0-n[
this means the for n == 11 the kernel splits the memory into the following sizes:
* 2^0 * 4 = 4k -> when a process requests 4k one of the pages marked here is returned
* 2^1 * 4 = 8k -> when a process requests 8k one of the pages marked here is returned
* 2^2 * 4 = 16k -> // // // // 
* 2^3 * 4 = 32K -> // // // //
* 2^4 * 4 = 64K -> // // // //
* 2^5 * 4 = 128K -> // // // //
* 2^6 * 4 = 256k -> // // / //
* .
* .
* . 
* 2^10 * 4 = 4096k (4MB) -> the maximum memory that can be allocated on system with order 11.

Notice: the order config is arch dependent. 
if allocating more than 4MBs, then use the vm apis.

#### Special cases for BSA
what if we are allocating something like 132KBs that is between 128k and 256k. how will BSA handle
this?
-> it takes memory chunk of 256k (64 pages of 4kbs) size and returns it.
What if there was no memory of size 256k available?
-> it takes one 512k memory splits it into two 256k pages. returns one for the caller, and adds
the other in the available 256k memory pool. this effectively handles external fragmentation issue.
but notice how bad internal fragmentation is. there is 256k - 132k = 124k memory wasted. this is 
solved by the get_exact_pages API. it minimizes interna fragmentation but does not eliminate it.
in this case of free the BSA is smart enough to know that this chunk was split from 512k memory, 
so it searches for the chunck's buddy (hence Buddy System Allocation) and combines them back in 
the 512k memory chuncks pool.

# Slab
slab is a linux kernel memory management component that sits on top of Buddy System allocation (BSA).
upon initialization it requests memory from BSA and caches this memory and then the appropriate
APIs are used to request this memory. there are specific predefined structs that are cached.
kernel and/or driver developers can define their own custom structs and register them with slab.
they can allocate and free such memory and destory the cache when no longer needed. 
in case of memory pressure, the kernel knows how to shrink the slab cache.
linux kernel provides three implementations of slab:
- slab: old classic
- slub: unqueued slab, optimized
- ....: ....

allocated memory is physically contiguous and CPU cache line aligned. same for BSA

# Kernel Api Documentation?
in this section I will try to document the internal kernel APIs for myself. 
- get_free_page: requests a free page through BSA (not sure of the name)
- get_pages: requests multiple pages from kernel through BSA(not sure of the name)
- get_exact_pages: requests the exact number of pages, treating the issue of internal fragmentation
  that happens from get_free_page/pages
- free_page(s), free_exact_pages: frees the requested pages.
- kmalloc: allocate memory through slab.
- kzalloc: allocate memory through slab but initializes the allocated memory to zeros.
- kfree: frees the allocated memory back to the slab caches
- ksize: prints the actual size of the allocated memory
- register_shrinker: registers a custom slab shrinker for custom slab allocated cache.
- struct shrinker{
  int count_objects: returns number of slab objects that can be freed
  int scan_objects: if count_objects returns non-zero, this method is called to shrink the slab cache.
}
- vmalloc: allocate virtual memory of size given
- vzalloc: allocate virtual memory zerod out
- vfree: free the allocated virtual memory
- kvmalloc: attempts to create memory using kalloc if failed fall back to vmalloc.
- kvfree: free memory allocated with ^
- kvzalloc: same as kvmalloc but zeros out the allocated memory
- kvmalloc_array: allocates n elements of size bytes
- kvcalloc: same as calloc in user space
- kvmaloc_node & kzalloc_node: allocates memory in a specific memory node.
- vmalloc_exec: allocate executable virtual memory (not exported)
- vmalloc_user: allocate virtual memory suitable for mapping in user space.
- __vmalloc: same as vmalloc but allows specifying memory permissions.
- checkout __alloc_pages_nodemask: the funnel through which all memory allocation goes through
- kmem_cache_create: create a slab cache
- kmem_cache_destroy: destroy a slab cache
- kmem_cache_alloc: allocates an object from slab
- kmem_cache_free: frees an object from slab
- devm_kmalloc, devm_kzalloc: allocates memory from slab with promise it will be freed.


# Kernel VM
Kernal has the ability also to work with kernel memory for kernel objects. there is a virtual
memory region in the kernel bounded by VMALLOC_START and VMALLOC_END-1. when working with virtual
memory, only when the memory is read/written the physical memory is allocated. this is called
lazy allocation or demand pagine or on demand allocation.
memory allocated is guaranteed to be virtually contiguousbut not physically contiguous.
Notes:
- must only be invoked from process context
- benificial in allocations for buffers and cache 
- Physical memory is allocated via page fault handler
- Page aligned

#### debug this
- /proc/vmallocinfo

# OOM
- Linux has a feature named magic SysRq: allows execution of system commands (syscalls) with
magic key presses. by default it is disabled. to enable checkout /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
- Linux by default allows overcommitting memory. i.e, virtual memory becomes more than the
available actual memory. (read opened tabs to understand more)
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_*
- 0: (memory+swap)(ovcommit + 100)%
- 1: (memory+swap)(overcommit/100)
- 2: disabled
- if memory can't be allocated or virtual memory exceeds the overcommit ratio then oom is triggered.
- oom_score: how much percentage of the memory allocated to the process is used. 
  (lowest: 0, highest: 1000) highest process wins an oom kill. 
  /proc/<pid>/oom_score.
  score is: current score + adj
  /proc/<pid>/oom_adj

# Cross compilation
- A module that is compiled for kernel vx.y.z can not run on kernel vx1.y.z or any other 
  kernel for that matter, same goes for different hardware.
  To achieve this the following must be done:
  - use the kernel src tree for the target kernel version
  - use the tool chain for the architecture (machine instructions) for target machine


# Ideal kernel module make file
- The "usual" ones â€“ the build, install, and clean targets.
- Kernel coding style generation and checking (via indent(1) and the kernel's checkpatch.pl script, respectively).
- Kernel static analysis targets (sparse, gcc, and flawfinder), with a mention of Coccinelle.
- A couple of "dummy" kernel dynamic analysis targets (KASAN and LOCKDEP / CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING), encouraging you to    
  configure, build, and use a "debug" kernel for all your test cases.
- A simple tarxz-pkg target that tars and compresses the source files into the preceding directory. This enables you to 
  transfer the compressed tar-xz file to any other Linux system, and extract and build the LKM there.
- A "dummy" dynamic analysis target, pointing out how you should invest time in configuring 
  and building a "debug" kernel and using it to catch bugs! (More on this follows shortly.)

# linux kernel modules
- TODO: write the rest of the info.
- TODO: create a template for your self
- TODO: find a module idea to implement (emulating a serial console)
- A module can be auto loaded via:
  - telling systemd about it /etc/modules.d/modules.conf
  - create a file.conf for it under /etc/modules-load.d/<mod-name>.conf with the module
    name inside
- if Module expects paramters this can be done in two ways:
  - via a modprobe file under /etc/modprobe.d/<mod-name>.conf
  ```conf
  options <module-name> <parameter-name>=<value>
  ```
  - if it's baked right into the kernel then it via the kernel command

- kernel has no notion of process. they are called threads. each thread is an execution path.
- every thread has a stack per privilige run (i.e, a user space thread has two stacks:
  one for user space, one for kernel space)
- to view kernel stack /proc/$$/stack
- syscall foo becomes sys_foo as a method in kernel, then sys_foo calls do_foo. 
  SYSCALL_DEFINE(n)(foo, ....) expans to sys_foo with (n) being the number of params passed
  to syscall [0, 6]
- ebpf (bfp for short) is the way to go for system app tracing and performance analysis on
  linux.

# Important for notes (debugging, style, etc.)
- debugging with dmesg in a clean output way (less corrupts the colors)
```bash
$ dmesg --decode --nopager --ctime # shows log level and human readable messages
```

- providing access flags as numbers is not favorable. use `include/uapi/linux/stat.h`
  to get stuff like S_IRUSR and the rest of the familly (remember POSIX?)
  anyways :D kernel community disagress checkpatch.pl raises a warning.


# TODO @ Work
- have security (spire & stuff) as modules rather than in the init process?
  - not really needed? why would we do that?
- have canaries run a debug kernel version
- validate the production kernel config for security. use the python tool mentioned
- validate kernel module settings:
  - do we use customizable modules? No? turn of loading modules..
  - yes? validate modules are forceibly signed before loaded..
  - can we load a non signed module? yes? sound the alarm, reconfig and deploy
  - No? phew we are slightly secure.


# TODO @ Fun
- buy a NUC
- buy a rasperrybi :cat-smile: (Yocto project, rasperrybi docs)

# Fun questions to look for
- where does the init execution happen? when does it happen?

# Further readings
- smem, pmap, sproc (in procfs)
